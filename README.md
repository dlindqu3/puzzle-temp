## Questions 
- NineBase: is there another way to get component to re-render at the right time besides using a second state? 
- NineBase: why do I need an arrow function on click? 
- NB: why do click events happen on load? 

## Citations
- To get the NineBase number click events to access target button value correctly, used "e.preventDefault()" and "e.currentTarget.value" as shown in lukaleli's response to the Stack Overflow post "event.target.value is undefined for buttons that wrap an image instead of text" at [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45882638/event-target-value-is-undefined-for-buttons-that-wrap-an-image-instead-of-text)
- To switch the order of the numbers in state, I referenced the article "How to use arrays to swap variables in JavaScript ?", at [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-arrays-to-swap-variables-in-javascript/)

  - Why? 
  - why  does only 5 move, not 2?
